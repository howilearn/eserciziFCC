The website where I do my tries.

<!--
I started this website at the beginning of 2016, to practice while I was taking an online course about Joomla.

At that time I was heavily studying English, especially because I wanted to use the great amount of Internet resources to learn about doing websites.

Building a website about learning English (based on my personal experience), seemed to be a good way to practice both English and doing websites.
